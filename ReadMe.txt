Reflection:
===========
     -- My biggest struggle with this assignment was figuring out the encapsulation ascpects
     -- Definitely overcomplicated how I would access Place in Places (tried creating extra, uneccessary methods)
     -- It was helpful to have gone over BufferedReader in class because I am used to working with Scanners and FileReader
     -- Good learning experience for working with exceptions because those are fairly new to me
     -- Overall, a more difficult experience, but helped me better understand encapsulation and other topics better
